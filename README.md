# Python-3

Python codes and notes for practice and learning

As part of my M.S. Business Analytics curriculum at University of Texas at Dallas(2019-2021) I practiced and worked on Python 3 based projects.
I like to share my knowledge and collaborate with people, which is the reason I'm here updating and posting my notebooks on GitHub.
If it has been useful to you then please download my public notes for your learnings. 

Let me know how your journey has been while using these materials.

#Cheers!!
