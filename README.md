# Python 3

Python codes and notes for practice and learning

As part of my M.S. Business Analytics curriculum at University of Texas at Dallas(2019-2021) with focus on Data Science and Data Engineering Tracks I will be practicing and posting my work on GitHub for anyone who wants to refer or review my work.

This work is mainly carried out on Anaconda Data Science Platform - https://www.anaconda.com/

#Cheers!!
